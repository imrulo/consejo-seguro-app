### The "Beli Karton" Anxiety
1. **🧠 What’s happening:** You just arrived or moved, and everyone keeps asking if you have your "White Card" registered.
2. **⚠️ Why this happens:** In Serbia, the police track strictly where every foreigner sleeps. It’s a remnant of older security laws, but it's efficient today.
3. **✅ What to do now:**
   - If in a Hotel/Airbnb: Demand they do it for you (it's their legal duty).
   - If renting: Go with your landlord to the local police station (MUP) within 24 hours of arrival.
4. **❌ What to avoid:** Thinking "I'll do it next week". The deadline is strictly 24 hours.
5. **⏱ When to worry:** If 24 hours have passed and you haven't registered. You risk a fine at border control.

### The Notary (Javni Beležnik) Barrier
1. **🧠 What’s happening:** You have a document (contract, translation), but officials refuse it because it's not "overa" (notarized).
2. **⚠️ Why this happens:** Serbian institutions don't trust private signatures. A "Javni Beležnik" stamp turns a paper into a legal fact.
3. **✅ What to do now:** Find the nearest "Javni Beležnik" on Google Maps. Bring your passport and a translator (or an interpreter) if you don't speak Serbian.
4. **❌ What to avoid:** Signing the document *before* you get there. You must sign IN FRONT of them.
5. **⏱ When to worry:** If the Notary refuses to notarize without a "Court Court Interpreter" (Sudski Tumač). This costs extra money and time.

### The Post Office (Pošta) Queue
1. **🧠 What’s happening:** You need to pay a bill or fine, and the bank app doesn't work or you have cash.
2. **⚠️ Why this happens:** The "Pošta" is the universal payment hub in Serbia. Old-school but reliable.
3. **✅ What to do now:** Fill out the payment slip ("uplatnica"). Go to any counter. Cash is king/queen here.
4. **❌ What to avoid:** Going on pension payment days (10th and 25th of the month). The queues are legendary.
5. **⏱ When to worry:** If the clerk says "Pogrešan račun" (wrong account). Double-check the numbers.

### The "Sverc" Dilemma (Bus Tickets)
1. **🧠 What’s happening:** You got on a bus/tram in Belgrade, didn't pay, and saw utility vest controllers enter.
2. **⚠️ Why this happens:** Locals often don't pay ("švercovanje"), making foreigners think it's free. It’s not.
3. **✅ What to do now:** Send SMS "A90" to 9011 immediately. It buys you a 90-min ticket. Show the SMS reply.
4. **❌ What to avoid:** Arguing or pretending you don't understand. They have heard it all.
5. **⏱ When to worry:** If they ask for your passport. Just pay the immediate fine (2500 RSD) to avoid a court summons.

### The "Divlji" Taxi Driver
1. **🧠 What’s happening:** You landed at Nikola Tesla Airport and a guy in a nice suit offers "Taxi, Taxi" inside the terminal.
2. **⚠️ Why this happens:** "Wild" (illegal) taxies prey on exhausted arrivals. They charge 3x-10x the normal rate.
3. **✅ What to do now:** Ignore them completely. Go to the OFFICIAL Taxi Info desk, get a voucher with a fixed price, and go to the first car in the queue outside.
4. **❌ What to avoid:** Getting into a car without "TX" at the end of the license plate (e.g., BG-1234-TX).
5. **⏱ When to worry:** If the meter is running fast ("turbine") or isn't on at all. Demand to stop and pay what's on screen.

### Parking "Zones" (Zonas)
1. **🧠 What’s happening:** You parked on the street, saw painted lines (Red/Yellow/Green), and don't know where to pay.
2. **⚠️ Why this happens:** There are no machines. Belgrade parking is almost exclusively paid via SMS.
3. **✅ What to do now:** Look at the sign color. Send your license plate (e.g., BG123TX) to the short code (Red: 9111, Yellow: 9112, Green: 9113).
4. **❌ What to avoid:** Parking in a "Blue" resident-only spot without a resident sticker. They tow fast ("Pauk").
5. **⏱ When to worry:** If you return and your car is gone. Call "Parking Servis".

### The "Infostan" Bill Mystery
1. **🧠 What’s happening:** You received a blue/white bill in the mail called "Infostan" and don't know what it covers.
2. **⚠️ Why this happens:** It’s a consolidated utility bill (heating, water, trash, building maintenance) for Belgrade. It tracks the *apartment*, not the person.
3. **✅ What to do now:** Scan the QR code with your banking app (IPS Scan) or take it to the Post Office/Exchange Office ("Menjačnica") to pay cash.
4. **❌ What to avoid:** Ignoring it. Debts stay with the property and jeopardize your landlord's relationship with you.
5. **⏱ When to worry:** If the amount is suddenly double. Usually means heavy water usage adjustment or debt interest.

### No "Ugovor" (Contract)
1. **🧠 What’s happening:** You found a great apartment, but the landlord wants cash and refuses to sign/notarize a contract.
2. **⚠️ Why this happens:** Tax evasion. Landlords avoid the 20% tax on rent.
3. **✅ What to do now:** Without a contract, you CANNOT get residency. Explain you need the "Ugovor" for the MUP. Offer to pay the tax difference if desperate.
4. **❌ What to avoid:** Renting without paper if you plan to stay >90 days. You will be forced to leave Serbia for a visa run.
5. **⏱ When to worry:** If they say "polako" (take it easy) about the contract after you moved in. This is a trap.

### Private vs. State Doctors
1. **🧠 What’s happening:** You feel sick (flu/fever) and don't know whether to go to "Dom Zdravlja" or a private clinic like Euromedi/MediGroup.
2. **⚠️ Why this happens:** Public health ("Državno") is free/cheap but slow and bureaucratic. Private ("Privatno") is fast, English-friendly, but costs money.
3. **✅ What to do now:** Go Private for minor issues/diagnostics (approx 30-50 EUR/visit). Use State for emergencies or if you have official health insurance.
4. **❌ What to avoid:** Going to the Emergency Center (Urgentni) for a simple cold. You will wait 12 hours.
5. **⏱ When to worry:** Difficulty breathing or severe injury. Call 194 (Ambulance).

### The Pharmacy (Apoteka) Logic
1. **🧠 What’s happening:** You need antibiotics or specific meds, but the pharmacist shakes their head.
2. **⚠️ Why this happens:** Serbia is strict on antibiotics. You cannot buy them without a paper/electronic prescription from a doctor.
3. **✅ What to do now:** Go to a general practitioner (GP) to get the prescription. Basic painkillers (Brufen, Aspirin) are OTC.
4. **❌ What to avoid:** Arguing or trying multiple pharmacies. The law is strict.
5. **⏱ When to worry:** If you run out of chronic medication on a Saturday night. Find a "Dežurna Apoteka" (24h Pharmacy).

### Cash vs. Card
1. **🧠 What’s happening:** You try to pay for coffee with a card and the waiter frowns or says "Keš only".
2. **⚠️ Why this happens:** Small businesses avoid card terminal fees. Serbia is still a 60/40 cash society.
3. **✅ What to do now:** Always carry 2000-5000 RSD in cash. Use ATMs of your bank to avoid withdrawal fees.
4. **❌ What to avoid:** Paying with EUR notes directly in shops. It’s illegal (though some accept it quietly, the rate is bad).
5. **⏱ When to worry:** If you have zero Dinars on a Friday night in a rural area.

### The "Menjačnica" (Exchange Office)
1. **🧠 What’s happening:** You have Euros/Dollars and need Dinars. Banks have bad rates.
2. **⚠️ Why this happens:** "Menjačnica" are everywhere, licensed, and offer better rates than banks. It’s part of daily culture.
3. **✅ What to do now:** Look for the "%" sign. Ask for the rate ("Kurs") or look at the board. Exchange small amounts as needed.
4. **❌ What to avoid:** Changing money at the airport arrivals hall or hotels. Terrible rates.
5. **⏱ When to worry:** If they don't give you a receipt ("Račun"). Always ask for it to verify the rate used.
